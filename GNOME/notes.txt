Notes on configuration
======================
- cursor-size is set since it is different for different windows for 
  some reason anyway.
- per-window layout set to prevent chrome from having its own layout. 
  Doesn't help...
- It seems to be impossible to change the filename pattern for 
  screenshots. It is not read from any dconf schema.


Manually installed apps (should be deleted afterwards)
======================================================
- GNOME Tweaks
- GNOME Extension Manager
- File Roller


Consider these extensions:
==========================
- System tray icons
- GSConnect
- Primary input on lock screen
- Quick lang switch to remove the pop-up
- Caffeine for sleep prevention
# Focus changer for super-hjkl shortcuts
