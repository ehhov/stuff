# Various Instructions 
## User and Group management
- `useradd -m name` -m created the /home/name directory
- `groupadd name` 
- `gpasswd -a user group` to add and `-d user` to remove. 


## Making xdg-mime respect links
Edit `/usr/bin/xdg-mime` by replacing all 
``` 
mv ${file}.new ${file} 
```
with
``` 
cat ${file}.new > ${file} && rm ${file}.new
```
But this doesn't help all that much, since all applications contain their own copy of the original code with the `mv` command. 

## Fixing hissing sound in headphones
For alsamixer
``` bash
amixer -c PCH cset 'name=Headphone Mic Boost Volume' 1
```
For PulseAudio

[Element Headphone Mic Boost]
required-any = any
switch = select
# Replace "volume = merge" by:
volume = 1
override-map.1 = all
override-map.2 = all-left,all-right

/usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/paths/analog-input-internal-mic.conf

switch = off
# Replace "volume = off" by:
