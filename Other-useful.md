# Various instructions 
## useradd, usermod, groupadd
`useradd -m name` -m created the /home/name directory

`groupadd name` 

`gpasswd -a user group` to add and `-d user` to remove. 


## Making xdg-mime work properly 
Edit `/usr/bin/xdg-mime` by replacing all 

``` mv $file.new $file ```

with

``` cat $file.new > $file ```

But this doesn't help all that much.

For PulseAudio

# Replace "volume = merge" by:
volume = 1
override-map.1 = all
override-map.2 = all-left,all-right

/usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/paths/analog-input-internal-mic.conf
