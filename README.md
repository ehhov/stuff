# stuff

Here, I keep all configuration files, which are accessed by apps through 
symbolic links generated by the `install.sh` script. You can find what 
this script can do by running `./install.sh`.

Some features are provided by programs that need to be compiled. 
`Makefile`s are in `home/bin/`, `home/dvtm/`, `home/dwm/`, `home/st/` 
`home/status/`. You may need to edit `home/bin/battery_log.c`, 
`home/bin/brightness_levels.c`, `home/status/battery.c`, 
`home/status/network.c`.

## Suckless
I love [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org) and 
[st](https://st.suckless.org). Information about patches I applied and 
other comments can be found in `home/dwm/notes` and `home/st/notes`.

Apps that may appear to be useful in the future: 

- guvcview(-qt) -- capture video output in real time and even do something simple to it. 

The Special directory: 
- Import `okular.shortcuts` in Okular > Settings > Configure Keyboard Shortcuts > Manage Schemes > More Actions > Import Scheme 
- Copy `30-libinput.conf` to `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/`
- Copy `dwm.desktop` to `/usr/share/xsessions/`
- If Firefox haven't taken care of the bookmarks, import them from `bookmarks.html`

On a new system, tell git who you are, using 
``` bash
git config --global user.name "First name Last name"
git config --global user.email "email@address.domain"
```
And then tell git to save your credentials, the following line makes git use a single account for all repositories. 
``` bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```


## Various Instructions 
### User and Group management
- `useradd -m name` -m creates the /home/name directory
- `groupadd name` 
- `gpasswd -a user group` to add and `-d user` to remove. 


### Fixing hissing sound in headphones
For alsamixer
``` bash
amixer -c PCH cset 'name=Headphone Mic Boost Volume' 1
```
For PulseAudio
``` bash
/usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/paths/analog-input-headphone-mic.conf
[Element Headphone Mic Boost]
required-any = any
switch = select
## Replace "volume = merge" by:
volume = 1
override-map.1 = all
override-map.2 = all-left,all-right

/usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/paths/analog-input-internal-mic.conf
[Element Headphone Mic Boost]
switch = off
## Replace "volume = off" by:
volume = 1
```

### pacman
For installed packages. 

- `pacman -Qi package` for info.
- `pacman -Qs word` to search for the word. 
- `pacman -Qg group` for the group members.
- `pacman -Ql package` for list of files owned by the package. 
- `pacman -Qo file` for the file owner. 
- `pacman -Qdt` for all unneeded dependency packages. 
- `pacman -Rs package` to remove the package and all its unneeded dependencies. 
- `pacman -Ru package` to check if the package is needed and if not, then remove. 

For packages from repositories. 

- `pacman -Si package` for info (double `i` sometimes).
- `pacman -Ss word` to search for the word. 
- `pacman -Syyu` to perform a full system update. 
- `pacman -Sc` clean cache with uninstalled packages.

For .pkg.tar.gz files

- `pacman -U file` to install.

In `/etc/pacman.conf`, uncomment the line `#Color` to have colored output. 

### Deleting commit history in GitHub
``` bash
git checkout --orphan tmp
git add -A
git commit -am "commit"
git branch -D master
git branch -m master
git push -f origin master
```

### CUPS configuration
1. Create a group named lpadmin.
1. Edit SystemGroup line in /etc/cups/cups-files.conf â€“ add lpadmin. 
1. Add the user to group lpadmin. 
1. Type localhost:631/ in a browser. 
1. Add printer smb://guest@192.168.1.1/Xerox3250. (the format is thing://guest@IP/name)
1. Use driver ph3250.ppd. Set yes in Share checkbox. 

### Thunderbird fonts configuration 
The font types you need are: Cyrillic, Latin, Other Writing Systems. Set their sizes to 18. 

### Making xdg-mime respect links
Edit `/usr/bin/xdg-mime` by replacing all 
``` bash
mv ${file}.new ${file} 
```
with
``` bash
cat ${file}.new > ${file} && rm ${file}.new
```
But this doesn't help all that much, since all applications contain their own copy of the original code with the `mv` command. 

### Cool dwm patches
Better patches are marked with +, not working with -, very complicated with ?

`fakefullscreen`, `flextile`, +`focusonclick`, `focusurgent`, +?`keymodes`, `noborder`, +`pango`, +`pertag`, ++?`systray`, `tilegap`, `uselessgap`
