My configuration for the suckless dwm
=====================================

The patches in dwm are:
- actualfullscreen
- alwaysfullscreen
- autostart (modified)
- deck (also with gaps)
- focusonclick (modified: fixed the bug with focus on horizontal scroll)
- focusurgent
- keypressrelease (modified)
- movestack
- pertag
- resetlayout (my variant, see the `view` function)
- systray
- tilegap (and a lot of layouts based on it)

My own features provide
- window title alignment control
- a way to restore the default layout parameters (mfact, nmaster, 
  layout, gappx, borderpx)
- a way to change gaps and borders in real time
- floating windows border increment parameter
- vertical tiling layout w/ and w/o gaps and monocle layout with gaps 
  (for a consistent look)
All functions written by me are placed in `config.h`, and all my 
modifications in `dwm.c` are marked with `//` comments. Patches that 
don't change functions from `dwm.c` are also placed in `config.h`.
