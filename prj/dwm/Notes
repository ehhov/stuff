My configuration for the suckless dwm
=====================================

The patches in dwm are:
x pertag
x focusonclick (modified: fixed the bug with focus on horizontal scroll)
x cool autostart
x systray
o alwaysfullscreen
x actualfullscreen
x focusurgent
x movestack
x tilegap (and a lot of layouts based on it)
x deck (also with gaps)
x resetlayout (my variant, see the `view` function)
- keypressrelease (modified)

My own features provide
x modification in the tag() function that allows to move client to the 
  previously used tag.
x window title alignment control
x a way to restore the default layout parameters (mfact, nmaster, 
  layout, gappx, borderpx)
x a way to change gaps and borders in real time
x floating windows border increment parameter
x vertical tiling layout w/ and w/o gaps and monocle layout with gaps 
  (for a consistent look)
All functions written by me are placed in `config.h`, and all my 
modifications in `dwm.c` are marked with `//` comments. Patches that 
don't change functions from `dwm.c` are also placed in `config.h`.

To-do list
----------

- Win-Shift-Tab to move a client to the latest used desktop.
